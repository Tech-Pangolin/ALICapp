          <p className='ms-4 p-text-group'>Financial wellness is foundational to holistic wellbeing. Without economic stability, stress accumulates, long term planning stalls, and health outcomes deteriorate. Atlanta Life empowers individuals, families, and employers with tools and strategies to build financial confidence and generational wealth.</p>
