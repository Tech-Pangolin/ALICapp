          <h4 className="ms-4 sub-header mb-1">What is Reinsurance?</h4>
          <p className='ms-4 p-text-group'>Reinsurance is the process by which insurance companies transfer portions of their risk portfolios to other insurance entities, known as reinsurers. Through formal agreements, reinsurers agree to absorb a share of potential losses, providing carriers with stability and protection.</p>
          <p className='ms-4 p-text-group'>In practice, this means insurers pay a premium to reinsurers in exchange for coverage of specific risks. For example, if an insurer faces unusually large claims due to a natural disaster, the reinsurer helps absorb that financial burden. This allows insurers to underwrite higher-limit policies or serve higher-risk clients without jeopardizing their financial stability.</p>

          <h4 className="ms-4 sub-header mt-4 mb-1">Why U.S. Based Reinsurance Matters</h4>
          <p className='ms-4 p-text-group'>U.S. based reinsurance plays a critical role in supporting the strength of the domestic insurance industry. Operating within established regulatory frameworks, U.S. reinsurers provide transparency, legal oversight, and financial accountability that safeguard the entire risk management process.</p>
          <p className='ms-4 p-text-group'>Partnering with U.S. reinsurers also ensures closer alignment with U.S. market conditions and more responsive coordination during times of crisis. These reinsurers offer tailored solutions designed to meet the unique needs of American insurers and policyholders.</p>
